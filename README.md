(WIP) A simple Java application to increase brightness from a image changing only some RGB values.

I did it for training purposes after some hours playing around JavaFX and two classes about image processing.

Includes a compiled jar in "compiled" folder.

> Note: Tested with Oracle Java 8. Should works with OpenJDK 8. **Should'nt** works with Oracle/OpenJDK 11 (anyway, untested :stuck_out_tongue: ).
